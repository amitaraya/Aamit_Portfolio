                    WZ is a Case and Document managing additional Add-On added to MS -365.Workzone is initially a Denmark
                    Government Project running from the last 25+ years and serving different services and playing an important role in their
                    technical ecosystem. Now, WZ has again been re- engineered with new technologies using React JS, Redux-SAGA,
                    Fluent-UI which previously was in .NET and C#.
                    Also, I was the part of Mobile Dev Team and closing working with them for developing the same WZ for mobile using
                    technologies: React Native, Redux, Headless.js, O-Data. We have developed the configurator app for managing content
                    controls.
                    It's an Add-on feature on MS-365 and Microsoft Products that enables END- USER to use WZ Add-ins. Using Microsoft
                    products like - Office, Word, Teams, Meeting and Mails users can create a Case (contains metadata information about the
                    case user or author). And can then also add different documents depending on different conditions (more specific
                    describing case). And as it is closely coupled with MS-365 so we can use different MS- 365 products for different uses. (i.e.
                    Connect with me: Portfolio | LinkedIn
                    Office for creating Case and attaching documents to it then Callender to highlight dates and Email for communication). It
                    is also automated means after a case is created and filed then it automatically sends notifications to the recipient.
